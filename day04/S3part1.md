# 🔶 AWS S3 🔶 

Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is one of the most widely used services provided by **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**. It is designed to **store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web**. It is highly **scalable, durable, and secure**, making it ideal for a wide variety of use cases like backup, archiving, big data, content distribution, and more.

---

## 🔶 1. What is AWS S3?

**AWS S3** is an object storage service. Unlike traditional file systems, where data is stored in a hierarchy of directories and files, **object storage stores data as objects**, which include:

* **The data itself** (the object)
* **Metadata** (key-value pairs associated with the data)
* **A unique identifier (key)**

---

## 🔶 2. Key Concepts

### ✅ Buckets

* A **bucket** is a container for storing objects in S3.
* You must create a bucket before uploading data.
* Bucket names must be **globally unique**.

### ✅ Objects

* An **object** consists of:

  * The actual data (binary or text)
  * Metadata (custom or system)
  * A unique key (like a file name)

### ✅ Keys

* A **key** is the unique identifier for an object within a bucket.
* You can simulate folder structures using keys like: `photos/2025/image.jpg`

### ✅ Regions

* Buckets are created in specific **regions** (e.g., `us-east-1`, `ap-south-1`).
* Storing data closer to users reduces latency and cost.

---

## 🔶 3. Storage Classes

AWS S3 offers different **storage classes** for different use cases:

| Storage Class               | Use Case                                 | Durability    | Availability | Cost     |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------ | -------- |
| **S3 Standard**             | Frequently accessed data                 | 99.999999999% | 99.99%       | \$\$\$   |
| **S3 Intelligent-Tiering**  | Unknown access patterns                  | Same          | Same         | \$\$     |
| **S3 Standard-IA**          | Infrequently accessed data               | Same          | 99.9%        | \$       |
| **S3 One Zone-IA**          | Infrequent access, one availability zone | Same          | 99.5%        | \$       |
| **S3 Glacier**              | Archive (retrieval in minutes to hours)  | Same          | Variable     | Very low |
| **S3 Glacier Deep Archive** | Long-term archive (retrieval in hours)   | Same          | Variable     | Lowest   |

---

## 🔶 5. Features

### 🔐 Security

* **IAM Policies**: Control who can access S3.
* **Bucket Policies**: Set access rules at the bucket level.
* **ACLs** (Access Control Lists): Legacy permissions (not recommended).
* **Encryption**:

## 🔶 6. Real-world Use Cases

| Use Case               | Example                                    |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Static Website Hosting | Host HTML/CSS/JS files directly from S3    |
| Backup & Restore       | Store backups of databases or files        |
| Big Data Storage       | Store logs, analytics data, or IoT data    |
| Media Hosting          | Store images, videos, PDFs etc.            |
| Software Delivery      | Distribute apps, patches, updates          |
| Data Archival          | Archive rarely accessed data using Glacier |

---

## 🔶 7. Pricing (simplified)

AWS S3 pricing depends on:

* **Storage used (GB/month)**
* **Number of requests (GET, PUT, etc.)**
* **Data transferred out of AWS**
* **Storage class**

Pricing varies by region. Example (as of 2024 for `us-east-1`):

* S3 Standard: \~\$0.023 per GB
* PUT/COPY/POST/LIST: \~\$0.005 per 1,000 requests
* GET requests: \~\$0.0004 per 1,000 requests

---

## 🔶 8. Example: Uploading an Image (Node.js)

```javascript
const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
const fs = require('fs');

const s3 = new AWS.S3({
  accessKeyId: process.env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY,
  secretAccessKey: process.env.AWS_SECRET_KEY,
  region: 'us-east-1'
});

const uploadParams = {
  Bucket: 'your-bucket-name',
  Key: 'images/photo.jpg',
  Body: fs.readFileSync('path/to/photo.jpg'),
  ACL: 'public-read'
};

s3.upload(uploadParams, function(err, data) {
  if (err) console.log("Upload Error", err);
  else console.log("Upload Success", data.Location);
});
```

---

## 🔶 9. Best Practices

* Enable **versioning** and **MFA delete** for critical data.
* Use **lifecycle rules** to manage cost automatically.
* Use **presigned URLs** for temporary and secure access.
* Use **CloudFront** in front of S3 for caching and CDN capabilities.
* Never make a bucket public unless absolutely necessary.

---

## 🔶 10. Common Pitfalls

* Public bucket exposure (check with Bucket Policy or Block Public Access settings)
* Incorrect permissions causing "Access Denied"
* Forgetting to enable versioning before needing rollback
* Leaving large data sets in expensive storage classes

### 🔐 **1. Why Are Files in S3 Blocked by Default?**

By **default**, AWS **blocks public access** to all buckets and objects. This is to **prevent data leaks and unauthorized access**.

This is controlled by **two mechanisms**:

#### a. **Block Public Access Settings (Account & Bucket Level)**

* Found under: S3 → Bucket → **Permissions** → Block public access
* It can block:

  * Public ACLs
  * New public policies
  * Any public access settings

✅ If this is enabled (default): **NO object will be public**, even if you set a public ACL or bucket policy.

#### b. **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**

* You can set individual file/folder ACLs, but AWS now discourages ACLs.
* ACLs give access to other AWS accounts or anonymous users.

---

### 📜 **2. What Are Bucket Policies?**

**Bucket Policies** are **JSON-based IAM policies** attached to a bucket to control access.

✅ With policies, you can:

* Make entire bucket or specific files public
* Allow access to only certain users/IPs
* Allow upload/download based on condition

---

### ✅ **Example: Public Read-Only Bucket Policy**

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket-name/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

> 🔴 This makes **all objects** in `my-bucket-name` **publicly readable** via URL:
> `https://my-bucket-name.s3.amazonaws.com/filename.jpg`

To use this:

* Uncheck "Block all public access"
* Paste this policy under Bucket → Permissions → **Bucket Policy**

---

### 🔐 **3. Example: Private Bucket Policy With Access to a Specific IAM User**

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowSpecificUser",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": { "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/username" },
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::my-private-bucket",
        "arn:aws:s3:::my-private-bucket/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### 🌐 **4. Static Website Hosting in S3**

You can host a **static HTML/CSS/JS site** from a bucket.

#### 🪜 Steps to enable:

1. Go to your bucket → **Properties**
2. Scroll to **Static website hosting**
3. Choose:

   * ✅ "Enable"
   * Specify **index document** (e.g., `index.html`)
   * (Optional) Error document (e.g., `404.html`)
4. Save

#### 📘 Important:

* Bucket name **must be globally unique**
* You must **make the bucket public** for this to work
* Use a **bucket policy** like this:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicWebsiteRead",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### ✅ Access URL:

```
http://your-bucket-name.s3-website-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com
```

> Replace `ap-south-1` with your region.

---

### 🔁 **5. Lifecycle Rules (for automation)**

You can set **rules** to:

* Automatically delete old files
* Transition to cheaper storage (e.g., S3 Glacier)

#### Example:

* Delete all `.log` files older than 30 days
* Move files to Glacier after 90 days

---

### 💡 **6. Bucket Versioning**

Enable versioning if:

* You want to keep **multiple versions** of the same file (great for backups)
* Useful for rollback and accidental deletion protection

---

### ⚙️ **7. Presigned URLs for Secure Sharing**

If your bucket is **private**, use **presigned URLs** to share access temporarily.

#### Generate with AWS CLI:

```bash
aws s3 presign s3://my-bucket-name/myfile.jpg --expires-in 3600
```

> This URL works for 1 hour (3600 seconds)

---

### 👥 **8. IAM Policies vs. Bucket Policies**

* **IAM Policy** → Grants access to a specific **user/role**
* **Bucket Policy** → Grants access to anyone or a group of IAM users (or public)

#### Example IAM Policy to Allow User Access:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["s3:*"],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket-name",
        "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket-name/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
